                <p>A student who is pursuing a degree after high school, at the first level of higher education at a college or university is an undergraduate student. Undergraduate students are typically those working to earn a bachelor’s degree, an associate’s degree. An undergraduate (UG) degree is sometimes called a first degree outside of the US. There are other types of undergraduate degrees as well outside of the US like foundation degree.</p>

                <h3>POST GRADUATION</h3>
                <p>The term “postgraduate degree” covers everything from postgraduate diplomas to master's degrees to doctoral degrees. Essentially, any degree that requires an undergraduate (bachelor's) degree as an admissions prerequisite can be considered a postgraduate degree. You might choose to pursue a postgraduate degree for a variety of reasons, including to change career paths, specialize in a highly-technical field, or move into a career in research or education. </p>
